When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I want to do this every time I develop software, because the remote serves as a backup: if my computer fails, I can recover
  the files from the remote. Here's some other reasons to use a remote:
  1. I can collaborate with other developers who use their own computers and push to the same remote.
  2. Users can download the software from GitHub.
  3. Potential employers can look at my GitHub account to see what I can do.
